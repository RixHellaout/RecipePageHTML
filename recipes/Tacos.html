      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>A taco is a crispy or soft corn or wheat tortilla that is folded or rolled and stuffed with a mixture (as of seasoned meat, cheese, and lettuce)</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
         <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
         <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
         <li>teaspoon garlic powder</li>
         <li>cup tomato sauce</li>
         <li>12 taco shells </li>

       </ul>    
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
         <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
         <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
         <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
         <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
         <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.</li>
