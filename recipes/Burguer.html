      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>A hamburger is a type of sandwich that involves a ground beef patty served between two halves of a round bun. Most of the time the meat is grilled or cooked in a hot skillet, though some recipes call for it to be baked. There are many different variations, and many restaurants, families, and individuals have their own preferred methods of preparation and added ingredients.</p>
      <p>The sandwich’s history is largely unknown, though food scholars often attribute it originally to Genghis Khan and the Mongolian army; the modern name is almost certainly from Hamburg, Germany, however, where grilling meat patties in the style of the modern hamburger allegedly first became popular.</p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef</li>
         <li>1 large egg</li>
         <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
         <li>4 hamburger buns (4 in. wide), split</li>
         <li>4 iceberg lettuce leaves, rinsed and crisped</li>
         <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly sliced</li>
         <li>4 thin slices red onion</li>

       </ul>    
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
         <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
         <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.</li>
         <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
         <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
